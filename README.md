# lis2-save-editor
Save file viewer and editor for *Life is Strange 2* and *The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit*.

**Note that the save files generated after the release of Life is Strange 2 Episode 3 (i.e save files created after May 2019) have a new type of compression/encryption, and therefore are not supported by the editor. Due to a busy work schedule I can not update it, but everyone else is welcome to fork and continue working on it.**
